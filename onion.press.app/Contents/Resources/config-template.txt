# Vanity Onion Address Prefix
# Default: "op" (generates addresses like opxxxxxxxxxxxxx.onion)
#
# You can customize this to any lowercase alphanumeric string.
# Longer prefixes take exponentially longer to generate:
# - 2 chars (op): < 1 minute
# - 3 chars (ion): 1-5 minutes
# - 4 chars (blog): 10-30 minutes
# - 5 chars (press): several hours
# - 6+ chars: days to weeks
#
# To use a custom prefix:
# 1. Stop onion.press
# 2. Edit this file: ~/.onion.press/config
# 3. Delete ~/.onion.press/vanity-keys directory
# 4. Delete the tor-keys volume: docker volume rm onionpress-tor-keys
# 5. Restart onion.press (will generate new vanity address)
#
VANITY_PREFIX=op
